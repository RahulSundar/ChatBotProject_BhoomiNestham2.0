1923)\n[29th May, 1923}\nSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\"The intention of the Select Committee which sat on the Bill of 1897 which now continues\nthe present Act, was to make the decision of the Survey Officer as to boundaiy conclusive\nunless it was challenged in a Civil Court. The judgment of High Court is Second Appeal No. 22\nof 1915 shows that the Bill as drafted did not cany out this intention. The main object of the\npresent Bill is to restore to the law the meaning which the sections were originally intended to\nconvey . The opportunity has been taken to bring the Act into accord with modern arrangements in\nsome other respects. The majority of the general surveys have been completed and the Act is\nnow largely required in connection with survey of estates or other similar areas, re-surveys,\nmaintenance and the like. For this purpose the clauses have been framed in more general\nterms so as to cover any such survey. At the same time the special provisions relating to\nsettlement of boundary disputes by Collectors have been merged in the general provisions.\nPower has also been reserved to the local Government to direct the survey or re-survey or re-\nsurvey is found necessary for the better or more convenient assessment or levy of irrigation\ncess, and to recover a portion of the cost thereof from the proprietors. Such survey would be\nbeneficial like to the Government and the proprietor and it is reasonable that a portion of the\ncost should be borne by the proprietor. The principle to be followed in the appointment of the cost\nwill be regulated by the rules framed under the Act.\nIn the same connection, opportunity has been taken to alter the arrangements regarding the\ncalculation and distribution of charges for surveys. The arrangements defined in the Act,\nunder  which  any  particular  landholder  may  supply  labour  and  stones,  are  not  really\nworkable, and therefore it is proposed in future that Government should pay the initial cost of\nall surveys and recover it. This will not prevent any individual landholder supplying his own\nstones or labour by arrangement with the Survey Officer.\nThe other amendments are merely, verbal amendments, rendered necessary to bring the\nAct up-to-date.\nSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS TO OLD ACT IV OF 1897\n\"The previous law relating to demarcation and survey of boundaries and to the settlement\nof boundary disputes was contained in Act XVIII of 1860 and Madras Act II of 1864, the\nlatter enactment having been formed in order to amplify the provisions of the former in regard\nto maintenance of boundary marks already  erected.  The  provisions  of  law  contained  on\nprovision enabling a Boundary Settlement Officer to summon and enforce the attendance of\nwitnesses or to require the production of documents, and did not require him to record theTHE ANDHRA PRADESH SURVEY AND BOUNDARIES... https://registrationact.in/Pdf/THEANDHRAPRADESH...\n1 of 56 12/17/23, 14:05", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3180, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13c53c19-9462-440e-a7cb-ed1979620750": {"__data__": {"id_": "13c53c19-9462-440e-a7cb-ed1979620750", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 151126, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81d8d52e-73ee-4467-8ca1-36a726ea4780", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 151126, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "c84e0f158c5528515bef727002481f483ad28224b2ac2d675e95004cc32ff207", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "98fed3db-2ef6-4780-9e39-5e9a023ab298", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 151126, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "e27e6ac379b7579f301aa82b497952c2663d9072f14b31c64a8b7f614bd3f8ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5f9f09a-56f3-4bae-9b14-bcaec248b307", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c37df5da5fe04c54f02c162b9319aa2221d72bd4b6b27e3300e0aa63f463449", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "evidence upon which his decision was based.

The  older  enactment  was  devoid  of  logical\narrangement, and while the more recent law, as contained\nin  Madras  Act  II  of  1889,  had  been  practically\nreproduced in the present Act, the provisions of both had\nbeen consolidated and amended, and the law recast in a\nmanner  more  suited  to  present  requirements.\nExperience had shown that the then existing provisions\nin regard to settlement of boundary disputes had been\nworked badly, and in several cases the Government had\nbeen put to considerable loss by the irresponsible and\nunsatisfactory  nature  of  the  original  decision.  The\nsections of the earlier Act providing of or a reference to\narbitration had been taken away, as it had been found that\nthese provisions were seldom or never used in practice, and\na decision of non-official jury or committee is in any case\nlikely  to  lack  promptitude  and  precision.  This  act\naccordingly  proposes  to  submit  the  decision  of  all\ndisputes to the Boundary Settlement Officer in the first\ninstance and prescribes the method in which he shall\nadjudicate  thereon;  it  however,  enables  him  with  the\nconsent  of  the  parties  to  refer  to  any  dispute  to\narbitration if he considers it desirable to do so under the\nprovisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nIn  order  to  remedy  the  evils  noted  above,  the  bill\nproposes  to  enact  that  the  decision  of  the  Boundary\nSettlement Officer who is to be styled \"Survey Officer\" shall\nbe arrived at in a judicial manner and power is taken to\nmake rules for the regulation of all proceedings taken by\nSurvey O\ufb00icers under the Act.\nthan in the curse of a regular survey has been made\nfinal until reserved or modified by means of a regular suit\nin a Civil Court the provision is in accordance with a ruling\nthen recently promulgated by the High court of Madras toTHE ANDHRA PRADESH SURVEY AND BOUNDARIES... https://registrationact.in/Pdf/THEANDHRAPRADESH...\n5 of 56 12/17/23, 14:05", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2170, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbf32624-ffcc-49ec-9212-c1d964f8227d": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbf32624-ffcc-49ec-9212-c1d964f8227d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 151126, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b88e4c1d-9f0b-4870-830a-7aec2a43021f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 151126, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "9a82372982d0692154e61ced46b333229b2d85a368dd62c3ed10ddafcaa5d515", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "94a1ab62-2416-4034-ab97-713095848ebc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/AP_survey_boundaries_act_1923.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 151126, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "cfc10e552879ce0c89c35cc8cc1574aa4a1db9ac62910a6b48b59d39945d5991", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f254a2ab-3909-4125-8ed9-b81320f81c49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "965e4f56d372fb07f4b5a093cf5c8a21e2e02d022e4c8c479eb8c4740965897c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "the effect that the decision against which any appeal is\nallowed in the form of a regular suit is  in  the  original\ndecision  of  the  Survey  Officer,  had  not  that  of  his\nsuperior passed in revision.\nUnder the 'Miscellaneous' chapter of the Act, a section\nhas been inserted to give the Collector or Survey Officer\nimmunity for anything done or omitted in good faith under\nthe Act.\nThe de\ufb01nition of Survey O\ufb00icer has since been framed\nso as to enable the Government to select any person it\nmay think fit for this duty.

What is GNSS?\nA GNSS, or Global Navigation Satellite System, is a generic name for a group of artificial satellites that send position and timing data from their high orbits. The GPS, or Global Positioning System, is just one of the many different sets of satellites that can provide such data.\n2. What is GNSS Rover?\nIt is an all-in-one handheld GNSS receiver.\n3. What is the use of GNSS rover?\nA Rover is a survey tool used to receive signals from GPS satellites and CORS to\ncalculate geo-coordinate position X, Y, Z with an accuracy of 3 to 4 centimeters with reference to the CORS reference station.\n4. What is Reference Station?\nAlso called base-Station, where a GNSS receiver is installed at a known location. The location is pre-surveyed by either traditional methods or by GNSS observation for multiple days. The reference-station then provides error data for every observation compared to its known location.\n5. What is CORS (Continuous Operating Reference Station) Network?\nA network of permanently installed GNSS receivers at reference stations and raw GPS satellites observations are continuously send to central servers. The central server processes and analyses the reference stations data and provide its data & corrections through Wi-Fi internet or mobile communication to authorized users.\n6. Is CORS available 24X7?\nYes, the CORS network is available 24 hours per day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year.\n7. What is accuracy of CORS network?\n3 to 4 centimeter X, Y positional accuracy.\n8. What is the advantage of CORS?\nThere is no need of setting up own reference station each time for estimated corrections, CORS provides real time positioning service with an accuracy of 3 to 4 centimeter.\n9. What are geo-coordinates?\nEarth coordinates: Latitude (Y) and Longitude (X) and Height (Z) in specific earth coordinate system. In India, n for civilian mapping & survey applications.\nDatum: WGS 84 and Projection: UTM\n10. Can I measure length and areas using geo-coordinates in Latitude and Longitude?\n    \n   The curved geo-coordinates in latitude and longitude coordinates are transformed to plane coordinates (in meters) using appropriate projection. In India UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator projection is used for maps.\nPRE-DRONE FLYING\n11. What is GCP?\nGround control points (or GCPs) are points on the ground with known geo- coordinates and can precisely pinpoint in the drone image for processing and generation of an Ortho Rectified Image (ORI)\n12. Why are planting of stones for important before drone flying?\nThe stones are planted so that can be clearly visible in the drone image and therefore can be used in the processing of ORI, ORI quality check and in ground truth & ground validation.\n13. Is it necessary to whitewash the stones identified for GCPs?\nThe whitewashed stones can be identified clearly and accurately on the drone image while processing to generate ORIs.\n14. What is the ideal location for planting stone for GCPs\nIt is based on size and shape of the village as per the drone flight plan. For details refer the SOP.\n15. Is the drone flying possible before planning stones for GCPs?\nThough technically it is possible to take up drone flying before completing planting stones for GCPs, it is not advisable to conduct the drone flying before completing the pre-drone survey activities. This is because planting stones for GCPs will improve the accuracy & efficiency of ORI generation and further for ORI quality check and ground truthing for creation of permanent survey records.\n16. What are the reasons for gaps in drone image?\nThere are two main sources of error:\n(i) village boundary .kml file may not be correctly generated covering complete\nvillage area & check datum set for *.kml file is set as WGS84\n(ii) drone flight flying planning should ensure coverage as per the *.kml file\ncoordinates.\nThere may be some operational problems like drifting of drone from the flight path while flying due to winds or set-up of flying parameters. The pilot may check complete coverage of village area before closing the flying.\n17. What is the ideal day time for drone flying?\nDrone flying is suggested before noon for better sun illumination and to avoid shadows.\n18. What is the solution for cloud patches in drone images?\nDrone flying should be avoided in cloudy areas. Re-flying is suggested to cover the cloud areas.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 4487, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71be7773-f35e-421c-b754-2ab89943ca2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "71be7773-f35e-421c-b754-2ab89943ca2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_name": "FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48345, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa8eaac5-af72-4155-a341-21cf5fc0391b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_name": "FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48345, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "efd814adb018041122d1a1a3f25e618c9b66fc44a0bee0488bfd866c2d165642", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb3569c1-9cdb-47f0-983f-9adda67aaf25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_name": "FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48345, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "9d694cf155267e7b070ea96475ceb2a364ed4a8e7edda3d59022a0d3197fe0f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb8bd52c-4df1-49dc-8426-7356aa519119", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d636a8ccf020b355c1aafbecb3c19418526a67d7c3f715031cdb90c479808af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "16.

Should all the ORIs sheets/tiles in a village be set aside, if some of ORI are bad? Yes, ORI should be seamless geometrically for entire village. If some ORIs are bad and not meeting quality check parameters, all the ORIs of that particular village should not be considered and request should be made for reprocessing.\n23. Can GNSS rover can be used for survey for generation LPM instead from ORIs? Technically yes. But the use of rovers in place of ORIs will be very time consuming and cumbersome. It will also be operationally difficult to extend to large number of villages as many more field surveyors and rovers will be required for the purpose.\n24. Why are the digital ORIs blurred and not useful for vectorization for LPMs and generation of digital spatial map?\nThe supplied ORIs are in ECW format, which is a lossy compressed image format, not suitable for land survey. The SOI may be requested to supply ORIs in geo-tiff format to meet the quality requirement for vectorization for LPMs and generation of digital spatial map.\n25. Can QGIS be used for vectorization of LPMs?\nYes, QGIS is an opensource GIS software. Even though the drone images are processed and ORIs are generated using AGISOFT METASHAPE, or ARC/GIS commercial software, QGIS supports all user-friendly image processing & GIS functionalities required for vectorization and preparation village spatial GIS maps.\n26. In certain cases, the positional error ranges from 1.2m to 6m and area error up to 10 cents is observed with ORIs. What is the solution?\nReject the ORIs and request SOI for geometric (position, length and areas) quality checked ORIs.\n \n   27. The soft copy of the ORIs are very poor, image is blurred & pixelated. Is the problem that of QGIS or Arc/GIS?\nThe problem is with the quality of ORIs and not with QGIS or Arc/GIS.", "start_char_idx": 3651, "end_char_idx": 7899, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb8bd52c-4df1-49dc-8426-7356aa519119": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb8bd52c-4df1-49dc-8426-7356aa519119", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_name": "FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48345, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa8eaac5-af72-4155-a341-21cf5fc0391b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_name": "FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48345, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "efd814adb018041122d1a1a3f25e618c9b66fc44a0bee0488bfd866c2d165642", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "71be7773-f35e-421c-b754-2ab89943ca2f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_name": "FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48345, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "12319989c1911f1363a98030560661b48e5b649f6f4ab9995ffca28647fce18f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "be683370-a05c-4d45-80a0-cea042da1768", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0a853c37caf9ded164a1d42b41f77015f044a2312ca2d5e5fddce71eafb67e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "25.

The soft copy of the ORIs are very poor, image is blurred & pixelated. Is the problem that of QGIS or Arc/GIS?\nThe problem is with the quality of ORIs and not with QGIS or Arc/GIS. If ORIs are in original resolution, QGIS can be used for enhancing visual interpretation quality\n28. Are ORI and rovers useful for survey in tall plantation and forest areas?\nIn thick tall plantation and forest areas, ORI may not show the ground and land parcel bunds, junctions. The Rovers may also not give accurate measurements due to GPS signal fragmentation. In such cases, longer duration of about 10 min to 15 min observation may give acceptable position (X, Y) and accuracy. However, this depends on plantation/ forest leaf canopy geometry & density and terrain condition. In such areas, due to technology limitations, traditional ground survey methods like chain survey may be conducted to meet the timelines. However, additional manpower will be required to be deployed in such villages.\nGROUND TRUTHING\n29. What is Ground Truthing?\nGround Truthing is the demarcation of undisputed permanent boundaries of individual land parcels with the ORI and PoLR data. The village survey team should conduct ground truth duly inviting all the land parcel pattadars, concerned Government departments and all stakeholders as per schedule dates-S&B act.1923, Sec.9(1).\n30. In case of land parcel boundaries that are not visible in the ORI, what is procedure to be followed?\nThe GNSS rover or ETS can be used to record the geo-coordinates of the field boundary points. Form-18 should be used to fill these boundary geo-coordinates.\n31. In case of joint holders, should the division land parcel be taken up during ground truthing?\nAnswer: Yes. As per the willingness of the land holders, the sub-division geo- coordinates should be made using rover. Form-18 should be used to fill and record the division geo-coordinates following which the division boundaries can be drawn as a dotted line in the ORI.\n32. In case of amalgamated lands, where field bunds are existing on the ground like aquaculture lands, should the division of land parcel be taken up during ground truthing?\nYes, as per the records or as per the willingness of land holders. The information is to be collected as per the Form-20. The division geo-coordinates may be made using rover. Form-18 should be used to fill and record the division geo-coordinates. The division boundaries should be drawn as per the dotted line in the ORI.\n33. Does the pattadars get receipt after ground trothing?\nYes, each individual is to be given a chalta Number in both Appendix-2 and Form- 16.\n34. In case some of the ORIs are poor quality and not passed in the QC in a particular village, can ground truthing be taken up for the area where the ORIs are good?\n    \n   Case-1: No. if any one of the ORIs of the entire village is not meeting position, lengths and area accuracies. This is because the entire village drone images are processed as seamless image to generate ORI.\nCase-2: Yes. If some of ORIs are of visually poor quality (image is blurred, not able to demarcate land parcel bunds and not able to interpret land features), ground truthing can continue with the good ORIs. The poor quality ORIs may be rejected and a fresh request made for enhanced ORI images.\nASSIGNED LANDS\n35. In the absence of the original assignee and their descendants.

X is enjoying the land for a long period. In this case in whose name LPM should be generated?\nAnswer by Assignment Department:\nAnswer by Assignment Department: As per the AP Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act, 1977, when the assigned land is possessed by other than the assignee, the assignment patta shall be cancelled duly following the procedure stipulated u/s 4 of AP Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers ) Act, 1977 and it shall be resumed and it shall be assigned to X, if the X is eligible1 for assignment following the procedure for issue of D Form Patta. Then only LPM may be generated in the name of X, till such time, it will be treated as AWD.\nNOTE FOR CONSIDERATION: Section 3(1) of the Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act, 1977, prohibits the transfer of assigned lands, clearly laying down that no right or title in such assigned land shall vest in any person acquiring the land by such transfer. Also, section 4(1) provides that in case of violation of such condition, the possession of the land can be taken after evicting the person in possession through the process prescribed in The Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition Of Transfers) Rules, 1977. Also, the appeal period (90 days for the appeal against the order passed by MRO with RDO and another 90 days for the order passed by RDO with the District Collector).\nFollowing the show-cause notice for cancellation, these may be treated as dispute cases. After the final decision of the DC and the assignment patta is cancelled, and if land is reassigned to X, then LPM can be generated in the name of X.\n36. A was assigned patta in one survey number but has been enjoying the land in some other survey number, LPM should be generated for A in the survey number assigned to him or enjoyed by him?\nAnswer by Assignment Department: The MMM shall record statement from the both assignees after explaining the status, if both assignees agree, then he will recommend to the Tahsildar to change the previous pattas/Assignment orders as per the enjoyment, then only LPM may be generated. Otherwise as per their pattas, land possession is to be changed, then only LPM may be generated.\nNOTE FOR CONSIDERATION: Alternately, during the PoLR process, the VRO may report all such cases to Tehsildar who may after due enquiry regarding acceptance by\n1 Eligibility of assignment include resident of that Mandal where the land is proposed for assignment; must be B.P.L; Ex-service persons (NCOs\u2019 only); Freedom Fighters ; Political sufferers with priority to be given to the land less poor who occupied unobjectionable Govt., land and doing cultivation\n     \n   both the assignees change the assignment orders as per enjoyment, followed by modification in the revenue records.

X. the present enjoyer on a D-form patta had purchased land in 1981 through a Sadabinama. What procedure should be adopted in the case?\nAnswer by Assignment Department: D-Form patta which was purchased through sadabinama shall be resumed u/s 4 of the Act.

Besides his own land, a D form patta holder is also enjoying 5 cents of adjacent D form patta land that he had purchased prior to 1977? Should D\u2019s LPM combine both the lands under his enjoyment?\nAnswer by Assignment Department: No, no D-Form patta shall be transferred or purchased, even it was prior to 1977, as the Act has come into force with retrospective effect and the assignment rules have also come into force from 1954.\nNOTE FOR CONSIDERATION: Shall we include the following:\nAs per the A.P. Board Standing Order 15(5), the maximum extent of land which may be assigned to the single individual, shall be limited to 5 Acres of dry land, taking into account, both the assigned and the lands owned by him together. Since he already has a D-form patta of his own, this would make him ineligible for reassignment after the patta is cancelled following due process u/s 4 of the 1977 Act.\n45. Land was assigned to A and mortgaged by him to a cooperative band m had purchased the same land when it was auctioned by the co-operative Bank. Should LPM be generated in the name of MP?\nAnswer by Assignment Department: Yes, there is a provision in Co-operative Act to take over the assigned land when the assignee became defaulter of loan repayment and to conduct option for recovery of loan amount. (Ex. Sub registrar, Srikalahasthi versus Guravaiah, 2009,(3) ALT85). In catena of judgements, the Hon\u2019ble High Court observed that the lands purchased in auction shall lose its character as assigned lands. There are no orders from the Government to mortgage assigned lands after 1999. However, a comprehensive report is under consideration of the Government for issuing of orders in such cases.\nNOTE FOR CONSIDERATION: A mortgage in favour of any co-operative society registered or deemed to be registered under the Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1964 is not regarded as an alienation under the AP POTA, 1977. Further, though the orders of the Hon\u2019ble HC that has upheld the rights of purchasers\n \n   from auctions by the cooperative banks, given the malpractices observed, the Government is considering taking an appropriate decision to address this issue comprehensively. In the intervening period, such cases may be classified in the disputed category.\n46. The land is assigned in favour X. The land has been sub divided and given new number as 1-1.

If any individual has patta land existing to his adjacent D-patta, can LPM be generated by combining the both land in his enjoyment?\nAnswer by Assignment Department: No, D-patta land and patta land (Zirayathi) should not be clubbed, while generating LPM.\n48.

In Divisions like Bandar, a large-scale assignment was made during the 1960-1970s under crash assignment programmes.\nAnswer by Assignment Department: These lands which were largely fallow with lack of fresh water irrigation facilities were converted into aquaculture and got alienated from the original assignees. Since the aquaculture was not brought in to the definition of Agriculture\u201d until recently, the resumption and re-assignment of above lands was not done all this period. The assignment registers of these lands, which were prepared about 60 years back are either lost or not available. The existing entries in adangal are also not reliable. In the absence of details of original assignees, the Tahsildars are not able to update pattadars names in DLR.\n2 After amendment Act, 2007, the right of the assignee to seek restoration of land after resumption even if he continues to be landless poor is not absolute. (MRO Vetapalem and another, 2007 (3) ALT 489)\n  \n   It is true, in Kolleru lake a large scale assignment was made about 50 years back, but in some villages assignment records were not traced, now there is no option available, except to conduct present enjoyment, survey and assigning to present enjoyers, subject to eligibility and duly following assignment rules, otherwise there is a likelihood of filing of WPs. Without conducting enjoyment survey and making fresh assignment, LPM shall not be generated, because large number of ineligible land lords are in cultivation.\n54. If in assigned lands, the original assignee transfers the land to another person who is enjoying the land for many years. Will this land comes under patta land or government land as notices are to be served separately during ground truthing? Answer by Assignment Department: As per section 5(1) (2) of the A.P Assigned lands (Prohibition & Transfers) Rules 1977, the transfer of assign lands to another person will be treated violation of conditions and shall be resumed the land and re-assigned to the original assignee or new assignee - or any violations observed with reference to the revenue records and enjoyment, that land shall be treated as AWD. An ex- serviceman who was assigned Govt. Land is not prohibited to sell the assigned land after ten years of grant. (S. Bade vs. Dist. Collector, Visakhapatanm, 2005 (5) ALT 635). But subsequently it was instructed such lands shall not be sold without obtaining NOC from the District Collector (G.O.Ms.No. 307 Rev., dt. 6.6.13).\nINAM LANDS\n55. \u2018A\u2019isenjoyinglandclassifiedas\u2018InamDry\u2019anditwas\u2018ServiceInam\u2019dulypurchased from \u2018B\u2019.

Ac 0.20 cents have been taken by government for building a road (without formal acquisition) several years ago and sub-division has not been affected. How much of land is to be shown in his LPM?\nThe LPM should reflect the actual enjoyment on the ground by A i.e. Ac 0.80 cents. It is to be verified from the requisition department if the acquisition proceedings were carried out or alternate procedures of land assembly like voluntary land donation. Further, the 8A register of the Tahsildar office/FMB may be traced to find out whether the sub division had been ordered and carried out. For the 20 cents, for which acquisition proceedings may have to be initiated, the nature of land/classification will be government/road.\n62. A owned 8.5 acres of land. 1.5 acres of land was acquired for the railways in 2001 though mutation was not affected.

What should be done in this case?\nThe LPM should reflect the actual extent in enjoyment by A at the time of resurvey, excluding the land acquired for the railways. The land acquisition awards should be verified if the compensation was paid to the landowner or deposited in civil deposits. The village records should be verified to see if the possession of land was formally handed over to the requisitioning department and if not, necessary steps may be taken in this regard.\n63.

How much of land extent should be included in the LPM?\nThe LPMs should mirror the actual position on the ground subject to consent of the landowners or be included in the disputed category. In case the enjoyment does not match with the records, the Tehsildar may verify records held by C (sale deed, Partition deed, Succession, will deed etc.) to rule out wrong entry if any in the Adangal and Pattadar Passbook. Further, the entire survey number has to be surveyed and if all the interested persons agree to the extent per the records/enjoyment, the Mobile Magistrate may record respective extents and the LPMs will accordingly reflect the extent.

Should the land extent be according to their share or as per enjoyment? Land extent can be recorded as per their enjoyment in LPM if agreed by both B and C, based on the partition deed. Alternately, if they want the boundaries to be changed based on their share, this can be decided by the Mobile Magistrate after due enquiry and LPM generated accordingly. If either of the same is not acceptable to both of them, land may continue to be shown in the name of B and included in the dispute category to be decided as per Rule 9 (1) (c) (ii) and decide their shares.\n \n   78. A has transferred 5 acres of land to his daughter at the time of marriage and she is cultivating the land. Can her name be incorporated in the LPM prior to validation u/s 5A of the RoR Act?\nRule 22, Andhra Pradesh Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Rules, 1989 (for regularization of transfer other than by registered document) requires persons to be recorded as occupants in Adangal/Pahani Patrika or in the Record of Rights. Subject to this requirement, the validation process can be taken up under u/s 5A of the AP Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Act, 1971. The name of the daughter can be provisionally included and finalized in the Land Register after the validation u/s 5A.\n79. Though the lands have been sold and purchased several times (registered), the name of the actual landowner, X is appearing in the Adangal and RoR. Can the name of new owner, Y be shown in the LPMs based on registration deed while mutation process goes on?\nIn all such cases, the mutation process shall be initiated early on. Under the AP Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbook Act, 1971, the entries in the [title deed and pass book] may be corrected either suo motu or on an application made to the Mandal Revenue Officer. The name of the pattadar may be entered in the Land Register after the completion of the mutation process.", "start_char_idx": 45141, "end_char_idx": 48267, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "144ab8e3-d0fe-4342-887f-01cd2bc7ebb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "144ab8e3-d0fe-4342-887f-01cd2bc7ebb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "FPOLR 04.12.2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FPOLR 04.12.2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 343894, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0c823622-fa53-4671-b29c-9f73bc69f191", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "FPOLR 04.12.2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FPOLR 04.12.2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 343894, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "e34986f796acfb5b41f609d455036582c99c14e7e8986875b1004e6a57c6d75f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1b7ccaa-e508-469f-ae05-e019402cff1e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_name": "FAQ Resurvey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48345, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "7f91d8ccc054241051bb0a2123c0c282a6dfe0249764e2e13d149f17abd1c959", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f9a785a-013a-48ac-bd62-ef15a9bc6825", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "64aeb8f1b6bbf9e314bc08afabfce5ca8861231f3c7252ce147d8e10c428017d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "O/o The Chief Commissioner Land Administration, \n                                                            A.P., Mangalagiri\n \nCIRCULAR\n \nNo. REV05/77/2022-CCLA & SPL CS, Dated:04/12/2022\n \n               Sub - Resurvey -YSR Jagananna   Shaswata Bhu Hakku\n                        mariyu Bhu Raksha - Field Level POLR  - Certain\n               guidelines issued \u2013 Regarding.\n*****\n1.Background \n       The Government of Andhra Pradesh, with an aim to provide modern,\ndigital land and revenue records has taken up the task of completing\nResurvey in all 17,460 villages in the state by December, 2023.   \n \n              During fled level workshops at Srikakulam, Ananthapuramu and\nOngole, Collectors brought forward the fact that there is a need to purify\nRevenue records even before the receipt of the Ortho rectifed Image of\nthe Village.

The judgment of High Court is Second Appeal No. 22 of 1915 shows that the Bill as drafted did not cany out this intention. The main object of the present Bill is to restore to the law the meaning which the sections were originally intended to convey. The opportunity has been taken to bring the Act into accord with modern arrangements in some other respects. The majority of the general surveys have been completed and the Act is now largely required in connection with survey of estates or other similar areas, re-surveys, maintenance and the like. For this purpose the clauses have been framed in more general terms so as to cover any such survey. At the same time the special provisions relating to settlement of boundary disputes by Collectors have been merged in the general provisions. Power has also been reserved to the local Government to direct the survey or re-survey or re-survey is found necessary for the better or more convenient assessment or levy of irrigation cess, and to recover a portion of the cost thereof from the proprietors. Such survey would be beneficial like to the Government and the proprietor and it is reasonable that a portion of the cost should be borne by the proprietor. The principle to be followed in the appointment of the cost will be regulated by the rules framed under the Act.\n\nIn the same connection, opportunity has been taken to alter the arrangements regarding the calculation and distribution of charges for surveys. The arrangements defined in the Act, under which any particular landholder may supply labour and stones, are not really workable, and therefore it is proposed in future that Government should pay the initial cost of all surveys and recover it. This will not prevent any individual landholder supplying his own stones or labour by arrangement with the Survey Officer.\n\nThe other amendments are merely, verbal amendments, rendered necessary to bring the Act up-to-date.\n\nSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS TO OLD ACT IV OF 1897\n\n\"The previous law relating to demarcation and survey of boundaries and to the settlement of boundary disputes was contained in Act XVIII of 1860 and Madras Act II of 1864, the latter enactment having been formed in order to amplify the provisions of the former in regard to maintenance of boundary marks already erected. The provisions of law contained on provision enabling a Boundary Settlement Officer to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses or to require the production of documents, and did not require him to record the evidence upon which his decision was based. The Act of 1860 contemplated a rough and ready settlement of boundary disputes, and with a view to expediting", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3204, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2ef9cc9-fc0e-4324-8833-494341260da8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2ef9cc9-fc0e-4324-8833-494341260da8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_name": "The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36819, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "36dd9043-75c3-4c8f-a0aa-3e84c69c7ee3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_name": "The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36819, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "ba7d472aa15bdc9d848a39de2451968b28472e468ae0da4481ad0f84b062880a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "59ef1b25-214d-47a0-ac93-455a598a77c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_name": "The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36819, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "8370e189d4ed0ec8f9fe1bd9f575e2736568b4e2b6351ecfc52b728c8265dcb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb49d2ff-3f00-4254-9288-79a6130bf93f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "24b480a9900c63b54644e8e1e27235511312db77d9b82ac95622955dc6977029", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "the conduct of survey operations by the Boundary Settlement Officer free to arrive at his decision without any definite method of procedure.\n\nIt was desirable to amend this law in many essential respects. The older enactment was devoid of logical arrangement, and while the more recent law, as contained in Madras Act II of 1889, had been practically reproduced in the present Act, the provisions of both had been consolidated and amended, and the law recast in a manner more suited to present requirements. Experience had shown that the then existing provisions in regard to settlement of boundary disputes had been worked badly, and in several cases the Government had been put to considerable loss by the irresponsible and unsatisfactory nature of the original decision. The sections of the earlier Act providing of or a reference to arbitration had been taken away, as it had been found that these provisions were seldom or never used in practice, and a decision of non-official jury or committee is in any case likely to lack promptitude and precision. This act accordingly proposes to submit the decision of all disputes to the Boundary Settlement Officer in the first instance and prescribes the method in which he shall adjudicate thereon; it however, enables him with the consent of the parties to refer to any dispute to arbitration if he considers it desirable to do so under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\nIn order to remedy the evils noted above, the bill proposes to enact that the decision of the Boundary Settlement Officer who is to be styled \"Survey Officer\" shall be arrived at in a judicial manner and power is taken to make rules for the regulation of all proceedings taken by Survey Officers under the Act.\n\nthan in the curse of a regular survey has been made final until reserved or modified by means of a regular suit in a Civil Court the provision is in accordance with a ruling then recently promulgated by the High court of Madras to the effect that the decision against which any appeal is allowed in the form of a regular suit is in the original decision of the Survey Officer, had not that of his superior passed in revision.\n\nUnder the 'Miscellaneous' chapter of the Act, a section has been inserted to give the Collector or Survey Officer immunity for anything done or omitted in good faith under the Act.\n\nThe definition of Survey Officer has since been framed so as to enable the Government to select any person it may think fit for this duty. This power has been taken in view of the fact that doubts have from time to time, been arisen as to whether any officer, such as the manager of estate under the Court of Wards, could legally be appointed as a Survey Officer under the Act. It is deemed advisable to leave the hands of Government entirely unfettered in this respect.\n\nAs already stated the provisions relating to the maintenance of boundary marks have been left practically as they stood under Act. II of 1884; the duties of Village Officers in this respect are prescribed in a new section 18 which is modelled on Section 27 of act V of 1880 (the Burma Act). The section relating to the conduct of surveys of Government lands have, however, been slightly amplified in order to meet the difficulty brought to notice by the Superintendent of Revenue Survey in regard to the levy of survey charges from the owners and occupiers of land surveyed. In the survey of a village the labour of the chairman and flagman for Field Surveyors had been supplied by the villagers, while the labour of these individuals when required for Deputy additional item in the cost of survey and in view of the fact that difficulty was experienced in obtaining such", "start_char_idx": 3208, "end_char_idx": 6907, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb49d2ff-3f00-4254-9288-79a6130bf93f": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb49d2ff-3f00-4254-9288-79a6130bf93f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_name": "The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36819, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "36dd9043-75c3-4c8f-a0aa-3e84c69c7ee3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_name": "The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36819, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "ba7d472aa15bdc9d848a39de2451968b28472e468ae0da4481ad0f84b062880a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2ef9cc9-fc0e-4324-8833-494341260da8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/bhoomi-nestham-v2.0/The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_name": "The Survey and Boundaries Act of 1923..txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 36819, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "62d327783e640ef02b223941db981a7446bc558ef43f2cff44455cd43ec36705", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eea8c7ca-b9da-464a-9056-877bc2481660", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fde9c6e41291bb188805916d4b7770af5e480aeaa43fff31af9fd9292982bbb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "labour free, even when required by Field Surveyors; the existing law had been amended and brought into conformity with the law relating to this subject in the Bombay Presidency (Bombay Act V of 1879, Section 97).\n\nAn Act to amend the law relating to survey of lands and settlement of boundary disputes.\n\nThis Act was extended to the transferred territories (Telangana Area) by Section 3 of the Andhra Pradesh Survey and Boundaries (Extension and Amendment Act, 1958) (Andhra Pradesh Act XXII of 1958).\n\nThe provisions contained in Act XVIII of 1860 prescribing penalties for disobeying summons, for making false statements for erasing altering or injuring boundary marks, and for obstructing operations undertaken under the Act, have been omitted as superfluous.\n\nPreamble:\u2014Whereas it is expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to survey of lands and settlement of boundary disputes and whereas the previous sanction of the Governor-General has been obtained under Section 80-A (3) of the Government of India Act; it is hereby enacted as follows\u2014\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n1.
